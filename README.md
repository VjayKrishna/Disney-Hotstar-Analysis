# 📺 Disney+ Hotstar Content Analysis
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Power BI**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth exploratory analysis of content hosted on **Disney+ Hotstar**, one of India’s leading OTT platforms. Using Power BI, I visualized patterns across genres, runtimes, release years, age ratings, and content formats to uncover strategic insights for platform growth, user engagement, and content optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze genre distribution and runtime trends
- Explore temporal patterns in content release
- Profile content by age classification and format
- Identify outliers and long-running series
- Provide actionable recommendations for customer acquisition, retention, and UX improvement
